Hi! My name is Lucas Castro and i have been working as a backend developer for 5 years.
My main focus for a long time was JAVA EE, now i'm expanding and learning new languagues such as JS and Python.
I'm passionate about programming, creating something from nothing.
My goals for 2022 are evolving my knowledge at Data Mining and Data Transformation.
For hobbies, I like sports and learning interesting things such as IoT, Machine Learning, reading about space/physics and so on!
